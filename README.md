# Portfolio of Works

## Description

This project is the first iteration of a mock portfolio to test my html and css skills.
Although there is still much work to be done and things to learn, this allowed me to apply my current knowledge to create a simple
layout with text and images.


## Features

This portfolio page has links in the upper nav bar that will jump to the corresponding sections in the page.
The images in the "works" section link to placeholder websites that will eventually be changed to actual sub pages of my actual work.
